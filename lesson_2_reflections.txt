What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

you create a place where metadata about versions of hte files will be saved

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

it is different from the repository in that it is a temporary area for things that may be 
changed. The repository is a record of all the files and changes. The wroking directory- I don't know what is that?
is that the files without the metadata?
