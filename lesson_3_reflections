When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-if you want to work on a different computer, somewhere in a differenct location
-when you want to share things quickly with people,or working on a file at the same time

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
 There may be some changes that someone else made perhaps that you don't want.
 
 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 
 forks are when you want to share on github what changes you are making
 clones is when you want a copy on your computer
 branches are when you want to make a new version and keep working on the old version too.

 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
 stored locally?
 
 in case you are off line or want to work off line on yourown computer, 
 you can compare different branches locally.
 
 How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what
 would be harder?
 email files back and forth/ or post files online for viewing
 github would be easier for this especially being able to see
 changes/commits and that sort of thing
 
 When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly 
 in master? What benefits does each approach have?
 
 if you are working on something that might not be good and 
 you want to save the master branch as it is and just explore your
 changes only separately
