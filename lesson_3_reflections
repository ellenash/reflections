When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-if you want to work on a different computer, somewhere in a differenct location
-when you want to share things quickly with people,or working on a file at the same time

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
 There may be some changes that someone else made perhaps that you don't want.
